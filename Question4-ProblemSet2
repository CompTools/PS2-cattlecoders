# 4. Within a function lists the cities in Florida that have airports in the dataset. (*2 points*)


awk '$6 == "\"FL\""' flightsTotal| awk '{print $4}'|awk '$10 == "\"FL\""' flightsTotal | awk '{print $8}' | sort | uniq > FloridaAirports

wc -l FloridaAirports
11 FloridaAirports

## To find "FL" in column "ORIGIN_STATE_ABR" ($6) then print column "ORIGIN_CITY_NAME" ($4), and the same in  column "DEST_STATE_ABR" ($10) then print column "DEST_CITY_NAME", sort and print just unique values (uniq)
