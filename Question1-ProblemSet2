# The goal of this project is to write a Bash script that:
# 1. Counts the number of flights that were delayed more than 15 minutes into or out of Gainesville, FL (airport code GNV) during the timeframe covered by the dataset. (*2 points*)

tr ',' '\t' < flights.May2017-Apr2018.csv | grep 'GNV' |awk '$13 == 1.00 || $16 == 1.00 {print $0}' > FlightsDelayedGNV

# tr ',' '\t' -> to change the CSV file for TSV 
# grep 'GNV' -> to find the flights into or out Gainesville,FL
# awk '$13 == 1.00 || $16 == 1.00 {print $0}' -> to find in columns DEP_DEL15 ($13) and ARR_DEL15 flights delayed more than 15 minutes


wc -l FlightsDelayedGNV
# wc -l to count the number of flights that were delayed more than 15 minutes into or out of Gainesville, FL (airport code GNV) during the timeframe covered by the dataset

1009 FlightsDelayedGNV

#ANSWER: There are 1009 flights delayed more then 15 minutes in or out of Gainesville, FL.
